#### Project is WIP - ORchestra

Starting work on the plugin version of the prototype Euclids Combinator. 
Prototype can be found here: https://github.com/Tronhjem/EuclidsCombinator


### ORchestra General Overview

This is a sequencer that generates and combines sequences using euclidean algorithms or manual input. 
It uses logic operations like `&`, `^`, and `|` to combine sequences into tracks that trigger specific notes. 
Each part loops and is evaluated with the specified operator, allowing sequences of different lengths 
to phase and create complex rhythmic patterns. Where it gets really powerful is when combining sequences 
of different legnths and hear how the operations creates interesting evolving patterns.

See more in the prototype repo.

### Tests

Tests are provided with a seperate jucer and project for a console app that imports select code and runs
the tests with the juce framework unit testing code.
