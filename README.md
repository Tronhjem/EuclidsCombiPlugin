Starting work on the plugin version  of Euclids Combinator.

### Euclids Combinator

This is a sequencer that generates and combines sequences using euclidean algorithms or manual input. 
It uses logic operations like &, ^, and | to combine sequences into tracks that trigger specific notes. 
Each part loops and is evaluated with the specified operator, allowing sequences of different lengths 
to phase and create complex rhythmic patterns. Where it gets really powerful is when combining sequences 
of different legnths and hear how the operations creates interesting evolving patterns.
